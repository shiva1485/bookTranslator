    This code converts the text in Tel.txt file into an audiofile of format '.mp3' directly into your desktop as 'welcom111.mp3'.

    You can change the contents in the Tel.txt file attached to this code and must add telugu chasacters only or if u want to covert any text language to audiofile then i must recommend you to alter the text file to english and also need to do minor changes in the code:

     --->Change the language variable to the language you would like to convert the text to audiofile.
                eg: 
                   For English you have to pass 'en' for language variable instead of 'te' which is for telugu.
